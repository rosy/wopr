  Wondering why there's no actual configuration here?  Because jBoss 6 eap wants to load the application context (which is defined in applicationContext.xml) as well as this file.  So if you define stuff here and not there, it'll fail, and vice-versa.  Therefore, we just leave it all in applicationContext.xml and this file lives happily empty.
